    <h3 id="overall">Overall Experience:</h3>
    <p id="overview">
        COMSATS Student Week is a week long event that takes place every semester after the mids. It is a great overall experience where students refresh themselves with tons of different activities and special events. It is a moment of great celebration and happiness all inside COMSATS where students and teachers equally enjoy themselves. My overall experience was fair enough with alot of positivs to carry forward and unfortunately some bits of it were also negative but I believe it is all just part of life. There is negative with positive. I'll conclude by saying that COMSATS Student Week is overall a good event with alot of unique memories to carry forward with. I hope it is arranged every semester regularly with the same zeal and effort at which it is taking place in the prsent times.
